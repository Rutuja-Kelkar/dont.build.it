        This tool is majorly helpful for age group 14-30 years who are focused
        on taking important and long term life’s decisions. "Living on planet
        earth" (as long as you are alive) on an average is a 60 to 80 year game
        and to pass life's levels[4] "long term decisions"[5] play prime role.
        All decisions revolve around 3 basic pillars, which are - Health, wealth
        and relationships. Although taking a decision involves personalized
        factors, instincts, and uncontrollable factors which can be deal
        situationally. Above mentioned are basic to consider. Most answers are
        found if you care about the basics and think long term.
